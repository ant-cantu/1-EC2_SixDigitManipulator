# Six Digit Manipulator

## About Six Digit Manipulator

This is a project I made for my computer programming class using C++.
This project was created within the first few weeks of my class and
is very simple and follows exactly what my professor wanted. I am
limited on the techniques I can use based on what we have covered
in our class textbook. This assignment is coming from my second
lab for the semester.

The application takes the users inputs of a six digit number
and manipulates it with the given instructions from the assignment.

## Getting Started

This is a standalone application, no installation is required.

1. Download the file
> [Click to Download](https://github.com/ant-cantu/Six-Digit-Manipulator/blob/main/SixDigitManipulator.exe)

2. Run the application.
3. Enter a six digit positive number.
4. Review the output.

## Usage

This application takes a six digit positive integer and seperate the number by making the 
1st, 3rd and 5th digit into one number and the 2nd, 4th, and 6th digit into one number. 
Once the numbers are seperated, the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two 
numbers are calculated. 

It is assumed that the user will enter a six digit numeric value as there is no validation check
in this application. I was limited on what I can use for this assignment and designed
exactly what the professor asked of me to design.
